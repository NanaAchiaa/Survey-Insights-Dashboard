## About the Project
Every survey tells a story. Behind the numbers and responses are people with experiences, opinions, and emotions. This project was all about uncovering those voices and turning raw survey data into an interactive dashboard that anyone could explore. My aim was simple: to make insights easy to find, easy to understand, and easy to act on.

# Purpose
The purpose of this dashboard was to help decision makers quickly understand what participants were saying. Instead of scrolling through spreadsheets, the dashboard provides a clear window into demographics, satisfaction levels, and feedback patterns. It makes it possible to spot what is working well and where improvements are needed.

# The Data
The data came from a structured survey stored in Excel. It included demographic information, ratings, and participant feedback. After some cleaning and transformation, the dataset became the foundation for building an insightful and interactive experience in Power BI.

# How It Was Built
I started with Power Query to prepare and shape the data. Once the data was clean, I created measures and calculations in DAX to uncover deeper insights. The visuals were designed to tell a story rather than just display numbers. Slicers and filters were added to make the dashboard interactive so users could explore the results that mattered most to them.

#What the Dashboard Shows
1. A snapshot of who the respondents are, from age and gender to other demographic details
2. Clear and interactive views of satisfaction scores and how they vary across groups
3. Trends and patterns in participant feedback that highlight both strengths and weaknesses
4. A way to compare results across different segments to understand diverse perspectives

# Key Insights
The dashboard revealed which factors influenced satisfaction the most and which areas participants felt needed more attention. By breaking responses down by demographic groups, it became clear how different audiences viewed the same service or product in unique ways. The dashboard transformed static data into actionable knowledge.

# Tools and Skills
Power BI, Power Query, DAX, Data Visualization, Survey Analysis

# Why This Matters
This project is a demonstration of more than technical skills. It shows how data can be turned into stories that guide real-world decisions. A survey is only valuable if its insights are communicated well, and this dashboard is proof of how visualization can bridge the gap between numbers and action.
